# GoldenFields
Project done at UIUC's annual AGCO Hackathon. Web-scraped and cleaned up agricultural data which was provided. After data clean-up was completed, a generated statistical model operated on this data and gave a suggested value of machine rpm, which would be used to maximize machine efficiency and consequently maximize crop yield profit.
